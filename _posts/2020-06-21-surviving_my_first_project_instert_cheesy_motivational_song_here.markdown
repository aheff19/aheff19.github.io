When Flatiron School said this would be a fast-paced program, they were not kidding! From day 1 I realized that I need to be on my toes and not slack off (slack pun intended). Earning my Masterâ€™s Degree seemed like a piece of cake in comparison, and this proved even more true since completing my first project for Module 1.

The start of project week, aka known as my first breakdown, my emotions, esteem, and brain stamina were put to the test. Can I actually do this?! Did I just make a huge mistake?! Perhaps being a health coach and telling people to eat vegetables all day was really *not* that bad??? 

Okay, I needed to get a grip. I took a breath, reminded myself why I went for a career change.

After venting to and receiving great study tips from my instructor, Yish, I felt better and felt my resolve return. And thanks to my amazing groupmates, Alex and Ben (aka battle buddies) I have been able to push through.  

The initial stage was a challenge because I felt like everything I learned in the lessons just flew out the window. For every little thing I needed to do, I had to go back and review and research. I totally gained a new respect for google. 

The panic set in at the initial stage of data cleaning. I remembered the tasks that needed to be done, such as grouping, eliminating duplicates, splitting, dropping columns, etc, but it was the how to be done that escaped me at the start. With the help of my instructors and groupmates, the material started to make more sense.

As the week went on, I found myself being able to remember certain codes without having to look them up as much, and my confidence grew a bit more in the reality that perhaps I can do this.  This project really gave me a good handle of Jupyter Notebook and more practice with GitHub (but I am going to find a video tutorial to do a refresher on that).

I also learned a few things about myself:

1. I need to really hunker down and study. And practice. And practice some more. Then do a little bit more practice- This is a truely a "use it or lose it" situation. 
2. I am capable of much more than I thought I would be. 
3. Don't be afraid to ask for help.  

Now as soon as I copy the link to this blog in the final project page, I can breathe and I can say, I survived.

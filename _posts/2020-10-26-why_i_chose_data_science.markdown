After a decade of being in Public Health, I began to realize I needed more.  Ever curious, I realized that I just don’t want to do the same thing everyday and craved more of a challenge. I began to research other options for career paths and came across web development. From there, I found data science and just knew it was the right fit. 

I like to know the why behind everything.  I used to work as a health and wellness coach- giving out health knowledge, in addition to trying to motivate.  It was not until I discovered data science  did I fully appreciate how much research and detail goes into those “tidbits” of information I would tell my clients.  This was fully realized while working on my Capstone project, where I analyzed a dataset regarding cardiovascular disease. 

Now, despite my healthcare background, it does not mean that I only want to work in healthcare. I am excited that now I have more opportunities to spread my wings into other fields.  What is nice about data science is that it is so versatile and can be applied to any industry. 

As I near the end of my bootcamp, I am very grateful at this step I chose. All the hard work and sleepless nights were worth it. Let’s see what the future holds…

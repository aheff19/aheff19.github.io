Time series modeling to forecast the top 5 zip codes worth investing using the Zillow dataset. README This project was made with the clients being a finance firm wanting to invest in Charlotte, NC. Charlotte is a finance hub with lots of finance people coming to find jobs there. My goal as a rep for a commercial real estate company is to research and find the top 5 zip codes this company would be wise in investing in. To do this, I did a time series analysis.

Below are the top 5 zip codes that were found, including the ROI and risk:


Zip ROI Risk 28270 1.04 .185, 28277 .984 .175, 28208 .922 .175, 28212 .899 .134, 28217 .781 .130
